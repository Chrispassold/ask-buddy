## How to use the typography

*Generated by Gemini

Material Design 3 (M3) defines a typography system to create visual hierarchy and consistency in your interfaces. Each typography style has a specific use and is designed for different types of content. Material Design typography is divided into categories, with different text sizes for each.

### Simple Summary

*   **Display:** For the most important text.
*   **Headline:** For titles that are not as important as "Display."
*   **Title:** For component titles.
*   **Body:** For the body of the text (paragraphs, descriptions).
*   **Label:** For labels (buttons, inputs, navigation tabs).

> Remember to always use the styles from `MaterialTheme.typography` to maintain consistency with your theme!

    *   **Where to Use:** Section titles or titles that deserve attention but are not the main focus of the screen.

*   **Consistency:** Maintain the same typography style for the same type of content.
*   **Contrast:** Make sure your text has enough contrast with the background.
*   **Font Size:** Use the recommended font sizes, but adjust them if necessary.
