## How to use the typography

*Generated by Gemini

Material Design 3 (M3) defines a typography system to create visual hierarchy and consistency in your interfaces. Each typography style has a specific use and is designed for different types of content. Material Design typography is divided into categories, with different text sizes for each.

### Simple Summary

*   **Display:** For the most important text.
*   **Headline:** For titles that are not as important as "Display."
*   **Title:** For component titles.
*   **Body:** For the body of the text (paragraphs, descriptions).
*   **Label:** For labels (buttons, inputs, navigation tabs).

> Remember to always use the styles from `MaterialTheme.typography` to maintain consistency with your theme!

**Typography Categories**

Here are the Material Design 3 typography categories, organized by hierarchical level:

### 1. Display

*   **`displayLarge`:** The largest and most prominent style.
    *   **Where to Use:** Important and eye-catching text, such as the title of a page in an app or on welcome screens.
*   **`displayMedium`:** Slightly smaller than `displayLarge`, but still very prominent.
    *   **Where to Use:** Section titles or titles that deserve attention but are not the main focus of the screen.
*   **`displaySmall`:** The smallest "Display" variant, but still large compared to other styles.
    *   **Where to Use:** Less prominent section titles or card titles.

### 2. Headline

*   **`headlineLarge`:** The largest headline style.
    *   **Where to Use:** Main titles, view titles, large and eye-catching text.
*   **`headlineMedium`:** A medium-sized headline.
    *   **Where to Use:** Secondary titles or sections less important than `headlineLarge`.
*   **`headlineSmall`:** The smallest headline style.
    *   **Where to Use:** Item titles, card titles, or titles that do not require as much emphasis.

### 3. Title

*   **`titleLarge`:** The largest text style for components.
    *   **Where to Use:** Top bar titles, text on cards, or dialog titles.
*   **`titleMedium`:** A medium size for component titles.
    *   **Where to Use:** List titles, subsection titles, or highlight button titles.
*   **`titleSmall`:** The smallest title style for components.
    *   **Where to Use:** Titles in sub-items, detail titles, or titles that need to be compact.

### 4. Body

*   **`bodyLarge`:** The largest body text style.
    *   **Where to Use:** Large blocks of text, main content.
*   **`bodyMedium`:** The default style for body text.
    *   **Where to Use:** Main text content, paragraphs, descriptions.
*   **`bodySmall`:** The smallest body text style.
    *   **Where to Use:** Auxiliary text, captions, help text, or footnotes.

### 5. Label

*   **`labelLarge`:** The largest label style.
    *   **Where to Use:** Button text, navigation tab text, and other interactive elements.
*   **`labelMedium`:** A medium-sized label style.
    *   **Where to Use:** Text input labels, chip labels, or list item labels.
*   **`labelSmall`:** The smallest label style.
    *   **Where to Use:** Tooltips, link labels, or extra details.

### Tips for Choosing the Right Style

*   **Hierarchy:** Start with `Display` for the most important titles, then use `Headline`, `Title`, `Body`, and `Label` for progressively less important content.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain the same typography style for the same type of content.
*   **Contrast:** Make sure your text has enough contrast with the background.
*   **Font Size:** Use the recommended font sizes, but adjust them if necessary.

## Material Design Color Scheme: A Guide to Usage

The Material Design color system provides a structured way to apply color to your UI, ensuring consistency, accessibility, and a clear visual hierarchy. It's built around the concept of a color scheme that defines a set of roles for each color, rather than just providing a palette.

### Key Concepts

*   **Color Roles:** Each color in the Material Design system is assigned a specific role (e.g., primary, secondary, surface, etc.). These roles dictate where the color should be used within your UI.
*   **Light and Dark Variants:** For each role, you'll typically define a light variant and a dark variant. This allows your app to adapt to light and dark themes seamlessly.
* **Dynamic colors**: it´s the next evolution of Material Design’s color system. Material Design 3 supports algorithmic color extraction for Android S, resulting in custom tonal palettes that can be easily applied across light, dark, and high-contrast interfaces.
*   **Emphasis and Hierarchy:** Color plays a crucial role in creating emphasis and visual hierarchy within your UI. The primary and secondary colors are used to highlight key elements, while surface and background colors provide the canvas.

### Key Takeaways

*   **Consistency:** Use the color roles consistently throughout your app.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure that your text and icons have sufficient contrast against their backgrounds. The "on-" colors are designed to help with this.
*   **Hierarchy:** Use primary and secondary colors strategically to emphasize key actions and content.
* **Dynamic Color**: use dynamic color if you´re targeting Android 12 or newer.
*   **The Material Theme**  is implemented with the `MaterialTheme` composable in Jetpack Compose, allowing you to define the color scheme, typography, and shapes for your app.

By following these guidelines, you can create a visually appealing and functional UI that adheres to Material Design principles.
